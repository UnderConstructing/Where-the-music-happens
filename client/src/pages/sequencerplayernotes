****Things I know
I have ids, and a sorter function for ids
I need to set classes for id === [step]
I have the classname package, which allows for conditional classes.
I have a transport set interval function that I can use to iterate through the ids

****Things I need to know
I need to know how to use props or state to make true or false the condition for adding classes
I need to know how to do that with exported functional components
